# CIFAR-10-Dataset-Analysis-and-Prediction
The repository contains python code implantation for Logistic Regression, SVM, CNN models on CIFAR-10 Dataset

The CIFAR-10 Dataset consists of 60000 32x32 colour images in 10 classes, with 6000 images per class. 

The code tries to predict the class of the image by processing the test images from the different Machine Learning algorithms.
